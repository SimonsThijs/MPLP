# Message Passing Learning Protocol
Reimplementation of the Message Passing Learning Protocol framework for my master's thesis. 



## Differences with the original
This implementation sometimes deviates from the original, the most important difference is that we have decided to not use RNNs in the linear nodes. This is done to make the understanding of the MPLP more easy. Start simple and gradually extend is the philosphy used.
